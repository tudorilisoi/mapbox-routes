This is a PoC for the Mapbox route optimization API

Given a number of geo locations, the API returns a duration-optimized route between those.

It also demonstrates basic Mapbox styling (as a side note, everything from streets to landmarks, markers, layers can be customized)

We're using the official `mapbox-gl` and helpers/utils on top of it:

# Optimization (the end goal)

# Helper library for geoJSON manipulation

<https://turfjs.org/>

# React libs for mapbox-gl (components and hooks)

<https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/>

# Styling the maps with presets
